# Same_Game
A project from my Intro to Java course as a college freshman. The game populates a rectangular grid with colored squares,
which are removed by tactical clicking. The different modes use different square-clearing behavior, cross gets all
horizontal and vertical consecutive squares of the same color as the clicked one, star checks diagonals instead, and
same gets every square that is connected to the clicked one by any path of solid color.
